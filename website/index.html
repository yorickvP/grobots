It runs on Mac OS, Windows, and (without graphics) Linux. Read the <a href='docs/overview.html'>overview</a> or look at some <a href='#screenshots'>screenshots</a>.<ul><li>You can download <a href='source.html'>source</a> and <a href='#download'>binaries</a>.<li>Read the <a href="docs/">documentation</a>.<li>There are many <a href='sides/'>sides</a> to play with, and <a href='tournaments.html'>tournament results</a> to ponder. The current champion is <a href='sides/segregated-eaters-2.gb'>Segregated Eaters</a> or <a href='sides/move-zig-3.gb'>Move Zig!</a>.</ul><p>We like to hear from our users. <a href='mailto:dschudy@yahoo.com,wschudy@alum.wpi.edu?subject=Grobots'>Send us</a> your questions, comments, and sides. There's also a <a href='http://groups.yahoo.com/group/grobots/'>mailing list</a>.<h2>News</h2><h3>Zoom!</h3><p>(Devon 20070912) New experimental feature: the main view can be zoomed in and out by typing '+' and '-'. ('0' returns to the default scale.) This means you have more flexibility in how much of the world you can see at once.<p>(Devon 20070930) That flexibility includes making the minimap larger and more detailed than the main view. :) But Warren improved the graphics yesterday, so it doesn't actually look bad. The main view is also smarter about scrolling when following now.<h3>Nativity</h3><p>(Devon 20061227) There's now a <a href='osx20070930.zip'>native OS X build</a>, based on a patch by Daniel von Fange. Some niceties are still missing (no icon, dragging sides to the application doesn't work) but at least you don't need Classic any more.<p>For interoperability (particularly important when switching from Grobots Classic), Grobots now recognizes either CR or LF as a newline. This works on all platforms, so you no longer need to worry about converting line endings.<p>[<a href='old.html#news'>Old news</a>]<h2 id=changes>Recent Changes</h2><ul><li>(20070930) Types view now shows damage multiplier for large types, and multiplier when pregnant with the same type.<li>(20070929) Main view avoids walls when following.<li>(20070929) Zoom keys in minimap now affect main view.<li>(20070929) Increased minimap maximum size.<li>(20070929) Improved appearance when zoomed in or out.<li>(20070928) [Mac] Now redraws after handling an event.<li>(20070928) Fixed crash when selecting manually added shots.

There have been no changes to the rules in the last year, so they all play the same game. We'll upload more recent builds when we have a chance to make them, but meanwhile don't worry if you have an old one. --><h2 id=screenshots>Screenshots</h2><p>Grobots is more interesting in motion.
