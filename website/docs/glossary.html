(This is a standard biological term.)<dt>biomass<dd>A side's value, including cells, fetuses and stored energy.<dt>doubletime<dd>How long it takes a side to double in value.<dt>early death<dd>When a side goes extinct in the first 4500 frames (a quarter of a round).<dt>gatherer<dd>A cell that moves around collecting food.<dt>heterotrophy<dd>Getting energy by eating other cells. (This is a standard biological term.)<dt>late death<dd>When a side survives the first 4500 frames, and goes extinct later. Late death rates are expressed as <code class=misc>late deaths / (total rounds - early deaths)</code>.<dt>seed<dd>The cells a side starts with.<dt>theotrophy<dd>Getting energy from manna. (This is not a standard biological term.)<dt>shadow<dd>Area around a stationary side where it has eaten all the food. A large shadow is usually considered good, because the food would attract enemies.<dt>sterile<dd>Having no constructors left.</dl><h2>Combat</h2><dl><dt>combat fraction<dd>The fraction of a cell (or a side) that's spent on weapons, armor, and other combat-related hardware. This is a size-independent measure of how heavily armed a cell is.<dt>defense<dd>Fighting in order to stay alive.<dt>offense<dd>Attacking other sides to reduce their biomass and increase your fraction. Usually works only if your fraction is already high.<dt>predation<dd>Attacking in order to eat the dead.<dt>missile<dd>A cell with a bomb, which runs up to a target and explodes. Good for taking out large groups.<dt>decoy<dd>A small cell, possibly shielded, that distracts attackers from more vulnerable or valuable targets. Good against missiles, and in other combat if you can get it to work.<dt>flyswatting<dd>Using a forcefield to make a target conform to a prediction, so it's easier to hit.<dt>plucking<dd>Using force fields to pull an unsuspecting enemy to somewhere you can kill it easily.<dt>swarming<dd>Bringing previously scattered fighters to a battle.</dl><address><a href='../'>Grobots</a> by Devon Schudy (<a href='mailto:dschudy@yahoo.com?subject=Grobots'>dschudy@yahoo.com</a>)and <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~wschudy/">Warren Schudy</a> (<a href="mailto:wschudy@wpi.edu?subject=Grobots">wschudy@wpi.edu</a>)</address>
