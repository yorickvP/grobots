Many of them also have menu equivalents, but the shortcuts described here are more convenient.<h2>Windows</h2><h3 id=world>World</h3><p>There are keys to select tools. Space selects the regular scroll/follow tool (click to follow an object, drag to scroll).<table><tr><th>Key<th>Tool<th>Explanation<tr><td>space<td>Scroll/Follow<td>click to follow an object, drag to scroll<tr><td>M<td>Add Manna<td><tr><td>R<td>Add Robot<td>click to add a cell of the selected type<tr><td>S<td>Add Seed<td>multiple cells of the selected side<tr><td>M<td>Move<td>drag individual objects around<tr><td>P<td>Pull<td>drag to create a forcefield<tr><td>X<td>Smite<td>creates a large explosion<tr><td>B<td>Add Blasts<td>a bunch of shots in all directions - good for testing cells' response to shots, or just killing them<tr><td>E<td>Erase<td><tr><td>A<td>Erase Area<td></table><p>Also, you can press return to follow a randomly selected object, preferring <q>interesting</q> ones like shots and moving robots. Tab will follow a random nearby object. If you were following something but scrolled away, backquote will resume following the original object.<h3 id=minimap>Minimap</h3><p>There are keys to change the graphics settings:<table><tr><th>Key<th>Meaning<tr><td>F<td>Toggle whether foods are shown<tr><td>R<td>Toggle whether robots are shown<tr><td>S<td>Toggle whether sensor-shots are shown<tr><td>D<td>Toggle whether decorations are shown<tr><td>T<td>Toggle whether trails are shown<tr><td>W<td>Switch between black and white backgrounds. (This feature was an experiment and may go away.)</table><h3 id=debugger>Debugger</h3><p>You can stop or start a brain by clicking on the status, or typing 's'. There are also keys for simulation control: 'b' steps the brain, 'r' runs, 'p' pauses, and 'f' advances one frame. (These exist because menu shortcuts don't work yet on  the Windows version.)<h3 id=side-debugger>Side Debugger</h3><p>Press 'N' to move to the next hundred addresses, 'P' to the previous hundred, or '0' to go back to the first hundred.<h3>Any double-buffered window</h3><p>In any double-buffered window (the main view or the minimap, currently) you can type '!' to toggle whether the window is actually redrawn, or '@' to toggle whether the back-buffer is actually copied to the screen. These are of interest only for measuring the cost of graphics.<address><a href='../'>Grobots</a> by <a href='mailto:dschudy@yahoo.com?subject=Grobots'>Devon Schudy</a>and <a href="mailto:wschudy@alum.wpi.edu?subject=Grobots">Warren Schudy</a></address>
